# Project ideas

## Raspberry PI Audio

Placing several raspberry pis in a conference room, meeting hall, etc.
that are equipped with microphones that record and perform initial
processing on the audio data to distinguish speakers and distance then
upload the processed audio signal to the cloud to be combined and
built into a cohesive recording of the event including speaker tags
and ability to isolate speakers and cut background noise.

## Raspberry PI cluster

Configure the 5 PI cluster to run kubernetes and write a Python
script to support routing jobs to the cluster. Use DocOpts and
allow user to specify: 

* folder to upload
* command to execute
* number of machines required
* timeout
