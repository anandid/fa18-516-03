# Notes about work on pi-kubernetes

## Overview
There are many sections in the book about pi and kubernetes. Currently there are
two complete sections in 
[chapters/pi/clusters/pi-kubernetes](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/clusters/pi-kubernetes.md).
I believe these are merges of
the content under
[pi/kubernetes](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/tree/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes).
